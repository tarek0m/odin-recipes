  <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1> 
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Meat</li>
    <li>Onion</li>
    <li>Cheese</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook the meat</li>
    <li>Make the cheese layer</li>
    <li>Bake the lasagna</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>Instructions</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
    <li>In a large skillet, cook the meat over medium heat until browned. Add the onion and cook until softened.</li>
    <li>Drain any excess fat from the skillet. Stir in the tomato sauce, garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Simmer for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>In a separate bowl, combine the cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg. Mix well.</li>
    <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish. Arrange a single layer of lasagna noodles on top.</li>
    <li>Spread half of the cheese mixture over the noodles. Repeat the layers, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.</li>
    <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes, or until the lasagna is hot and bubbly.</li>
    <li>Let the lasagna cool for a few minutes before serving. Enjoy!</li>
